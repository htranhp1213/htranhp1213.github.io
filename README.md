### My recent Projects
**PRIVIC Privacy-preserving Privacy Location framework**
-	Implemented the PRIVIC pipeline for iterative geolocation data collection with Bayesian updating.
-	Designed adaptive sampling methods (normalized KW distance, error-driven re-sampling) to dynamically reduce information leakage while maintaining accuracy using Python.
-	Conducted experiments on 800,000+ Mecklenburg County voters data, mapping addresses into 16×16 grids for privacy–utility tradeoff evaluation.
-	Generated report with all results observed from experiments

**DNABERT-2 Membership Inference Attack (MIA)**
-	Investigated the vulnerability of genomic language models (DNABERT-2) to membership inference attacks using Python. 
-	Generated embedding representations from DNABERT-2 and performed statistical tests to distinguish 5000 training vs. 2 million+ non-training samples using mean pooling and max pooling.
-	Demonstrated risks of privacy leakage in genomic AI models, highlighting gaps in current data protection approaches.
